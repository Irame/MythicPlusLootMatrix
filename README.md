# MythicPlusLootMatrix

This is a addon for World of Warcraft to help you find which mythic+ dungeon drops loot that you need.

## How to use

To use just type `/mplm` or use the addon compartment. The addon lists all Items dropt for a specific class or spec in all dungeons in a matrix where the rows are dungeons and columns are slots.
